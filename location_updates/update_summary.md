# APN Location Update Summary

## Overview
A script was created and executed to update APN locations in the database from the Excel file `EMPLACEMENT le 15.03.2025 (3).xlsx`.

## Process Details
1. Read data from the Excel file, sheet "Emp"
2. Filtered rows where the "PROCESS" column contains "ROB"
3. Extracted APN numbers from column B and location information from column G ("Emplacement")
4. Updated the APN database with the location information

## Results
- **Total ROB records in Excel**: 300
- **Successfully updated APNs**: 94
- **APNs not found in database**: 206

## Sample APNs Not Found
The following APNs were in the Excel file but were not found in the database:
10881371, 10881373, 10881378, 10881386, 10881387, 10881585, 10881587, 10881627, 10881631, 10881632

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding the missing APNs to the database if they are still relevant
2. Run the script periodically when the Excel file is updated
3. Verify the updated locations in the APN Database interface

## Script Information
The update was performed using a Python script (`update_locations.py`) that:
- Uses pandas to read the Excel data
- Applies data validation and formatting
- Connects to the SQLite database
- Updates the APN table with location information
- Logs detailed information about the process

The script can be run again at any time to refresh the location data.
